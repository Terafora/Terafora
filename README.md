### Hi there 👋

<!--
**terrafora1/terrafora1** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working my way through the content laid out by Code Institute as well as Dr. Angela Yu's 100 days of Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently focussing my learning on React and Python.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything as I'm always looking for further experience.
- 🤔 I’m not looking for help with anything at just this moment, but keep watching this space.
- 📫 How to reach me: Charlie.stone649@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak English, Japanese, and some French
